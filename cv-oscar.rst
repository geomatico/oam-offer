Contributions to GFOSS projects
-------------------------------

* GeoNetwork: OpenSearch interface improvements -- incorporated "geo" extension (aka filtering by bbox) http://trac.osgeo.org/geonetwork/ticket/190

* CatalogConnector: Added KML, Atom and GeoRSS response formats, and OpenSearch-geo interface. CatalogConnector launches distributed queries to a collection of CSW catalogs, and displays all the results in a single view -- distributed searches as opposed to harvesting (http://sourceforge.net/p/catalogconnecto/code/HEAD/tree/src/org/idec/catalog/) http://www.geoportal-idec.cat/geoportal/catalogconnector/OpenSearchCatalogConnectorManual.pdf

* GeoTools and GeoServer: Incorporated NTv2 Grid Shift and Custom (user-defined) coordinate transforms.

* Geotalleres: Contributed base GeoServer documentation. Geotalleres is a creative commons collectively built documentation project for Spanish training on Geospatial FOSS. https://github.com/geotalleres/geotalleres 

* Minor contributions to other projects: 52n SOS server, OpenTripPlanner, web2py.

* OpenLayers 2: OpenSearch-geo test client. Not merged on Trunk, lives in a (stale) sandbox: http://dev.openlayers.org/sandbox/oscar.fonts/opensearch/lib/
