Dear OpenAerialMap team,

We are Micho Garcia and Oscar Fonts, two freelance Open Source Geospatial developers and active dynamizers in the the Spanish Open Source Geospatial communities. We are charter members in the OSGeo Spanish chapter, started our local "Geoinquietos" (GeoGeeks) groups in our respective places (Galicia and Barcelona), and usually sponsor and organize spanish FOSS4G events (GeoCamp unconferences, annual SIG Libre conference).

We believe in freedom and open collaboration not only for code or data, but in our professional lives. There are ethical, but also practical reasons for this. That's why we chose to be "free as in freelance", but at the same time created the "geomati.co" professional network, so we can learn from each other and team up for non trivial developments. Besides from being stimulating, working in a team leads to better quality outcomes, especially regarding design and documentation. Whenever we are allowed to, our code is public.

We work mainly as integrators of different components to build custom geospatial solutions, generally web map viewers or data visualization portals. Despite not being core commiters, we have had the opportunity to dive into many projects, and contributed modest patches to most of them. For example, in the Java front, we have contributed some lines of code to GeoTools, GeoServer, GeoNetwork, Thredds, gvSIG, 52n SOS server, or OpenTripPlanner.

But we lately tend to use Python to build our custom APIs (Django, Flask, web2py), while the "web application" tends to be 100% Javascript in the browser, or Android, so it is independent from the server technology. Of course it helps a lot to have standard web services and client implementations.

Experience told us that developing software is hard, but mantaining it is even harder. So with te time we tend to think much more on lowering the barrier to future change: flexibility and understandability, and have in mind the future mantainers (could be ourselves!). Using a too modern tool, with an unmature "ecosystem" around, can be counterproductive as well (for instance, developing Angular directives feels like digging a hole into vendor lock-in).
